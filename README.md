# Symmetry Evolution Codebase

The repository we use to answer questions about the symmetry evolution in the light
of paragenetic modes, defined by [Bob Hazen et al in 2021](http://minsocam.org/MSA/Ammin/AM_Preprints/8099HazenPreprint.pdf). 

We are using open-access [RRUFF](https://rruff.info/) data for building the warehouse and testing 
our hypotheses.

Clone the repo and feel free to contribute by using command
~~~
git clone git@github.com:mineralogy-rocks/symmetry-evolution.git
~~~ 

Next, open the repo using your favourite IDE and initialize virtual environment using
~~~
python3 -m venv venv
~~~
Point your IDE to use the Python Interpreter from ``venv/bin/python``.

Next, install all the dependencies in the project from ``src/requirements.txt`` if your IDE didn't installed
those automatically. Navigate to your repo from the terminal and enter:
~~~
1. source venv/bin/activate  # activates virtual environment

2. pip3 install -r src/requirements.txt # install dependencies

3. deactivate # deactivate virtual environment
~~~

Please, don't push your code directly into **main**
branch - create new branch instead eg *feature/calculate-symmetry-indices* and use that one for
the development. Once ready for the deployment, you can create a **PR** and Liubomyr Gavryliv will 
review your code and merge it into the **main** branch.
